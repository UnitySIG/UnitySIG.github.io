h1. Inaugural IGDA Unity SIG  Meeting

h2. LOCATION

GDC 2014, San Francisco, California
North Hall Moscone Center, ROOM 114
March 19th 2014, 5-6 pm

h2. NOTES

Introduced our founders and Steering Comittee Members: Oded Sharon (Acting Chair), Mike Croswell (Acting Secretary) and Emil (AngryAnt) Johansen (Acting Co-Chair). 

Other co-founders introduced themselves later: Phil Ludington (DC Unity SIG) and Dan Fischbach (affiliated with Philadelphia Unity Group).

We covered the Mission Statement and since it is a work in progress we gathered the attendees' ideas of what they think the emphasis of our group should be.

h3. Key Goals (Including New Ideas)

# Connecting Groups and Individuals  - Includes Local to Local, All Unity Users & Unity Technlogy Employees (*You!*) to each other, Noobs to Pros, Educators to Learners and those in-between, Users to Unity Technologies and Vice-Versa.
# Assessing Skills - I think the idea here was perhaps to use this for helping us know our weaknesses and strengths as well as for self-promotion?
# Best Practices - This area could have many sub-areas, like Programming, Asset Preparation and Organization, etc.
# Tips & Tricks - As above.  Lots of areas here!  Things that are not necessarily published at Unity (yet!) or at least not found in one central location as we will have.
# Webinars - This is where all the Local Unity SIGS can share with individuals and groups.  Individuals could share their particular expertise, or learning experiences with others, etc.  All levels!
# Education (at multiple levels) - As above.  Miinimally, might hold links to existing educational areas[1].
# Unity Developer Voice   - Used to filter and communicate the desires/wants/needs of developers to Unity Technologies.  Examples include Input and Accessibility.  Advocacy - but friendly!

fn1.  Unity Technologies already does a good job, so once again we don't want to "reinvent the wheel".  Still, there is lots of room for presenting information from a different point of view, or expanding on those areas where the Unity website is weak.

fn2.  Didn't think to start on that until we were half way around the room. :-)
