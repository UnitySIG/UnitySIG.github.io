h2. GDC 14 Rountable Meeting

At this years GDC we held the first meeting of the SIG on Wednesday 19th at 1700. 
We had a decent turnout and would like to thank those that showed-up and those that would've if they could've.  
Special thanks to those that added value to our Mission Statement (see notes).


The meeting agenda covered the following:

# A brief overview of the Unity SIG Mission Statement.
# Discussion on various goals, including:
** Communications between Unity users and between Unity users and Unity staff. 
** Inclusiveness of pros, indie and solo developers alike.
** Involving chapters in local activities.
# Collaborative brainstorming on the role and creation of the SIG site. 
# Other new ideas included:
** Advocacy (creating a concise list for things like Accessibility Input Mapping)
** Best Practices (sort of an offical condensed version of some of the lists already "out there").
** Web-based Education, Tutorials and Presentations
